##What are the benefits of using AngularJS
1. Dependency Injection : Dependency Injection is something AngularJS does quite well. If you are new to Dependency Injection, don't worry, we will discuss it in detail with examples in a later video.

2. Two Way Data-Binding : One of the most useful feature in AngularJS is the Two Way Data-Binding. The Two Way Data-Binding, keeps the model and the view in sync at all times, that is a change in the model updates the view and a change in the view updates the model. 

3. Testing : Testing is an area where Angular really shines. Angular is designed with testing in mind right from the start. Angular makes it very easy to test any of it's components through both unit testing and end to end testing. So there's really no excuse for not testing any of your angular application code.

4. Model View Controller : With angular it is very easy to develop applications in a clean MVC way. All you have to do is split your application code into MVC components. The rest, that is managing those components and connecting them together is done by angular.

5. Many more benefits like controlling the behaviour of DOM elements using directives and the flexibility that angular filters provide.
